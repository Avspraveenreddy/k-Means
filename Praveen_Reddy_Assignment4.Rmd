#Question-2
#Interpretaion:
# The pharmaceutical dataset underwent k-means clustering, categorizing data points into 5 clusters
#based on similarities. Notably, Cluster 3 emerged as the largest, indicating companies within this
#cluster shared similar financial characteristics. Conversely, Cluster 2 comprised only two countries,
#signifying distinctive traits setting them apart. Cluster 5 exhibited superior financial performance
#with elevated asset turnover, ROA, and ROE, while Cluster 2 displayed a higher P/E ratio.
# 
# Assessing the homogeneity of clusters using the within-cluster sum of squared distances (WSSD) revealed 
#that Cluster 2 demonstrated less uniformity than Cluster 1. This suggests a broader range of characteristics 
#among countries in Cluster 2 compared to those in Cluster 1. These findings offer valuable insights into patterns and trends #within the pharmaceutical industry, shedding light on distinctions in financial performance among countries
#and companies.
# 
# In summary, employing k-means clustering facilitated the delineation of distinct clusters, enabling
#the identification of both similarities and differences within the pharmaceutical sector. These insights
#can inform strategic development, allowing targeted approaches for specific clusters and ultimately
#enhancing the overall financial performance of companies within the industry.

#low-risk investment.

#Cluster -2 comprises a blend of American and Canadian companies listed on the NYSE, with a recommendation
#leaning towards #moderate buy or hold. This suggests they possess growth potential but may also entail 
#some level of risk.

#Companies in Cluster -3, originating from various locations and listed on the NYSE, receive a moderate buy 
#or sell #recommendation, indicating potential for growth.

#Cluster -4 encompasses companies from Germany and the USA listed on stock exchanges other than 
#NYSE (AMEX and NASDAQ). They are #advised to hold or moderately buy.

#In Cluster -5, companies from the UK and USA receive a partial hold and buy recommendation for their stocks
#listed on the NYSE. #This suggests potential for growth but also entails some level of risk.

#Question-4
#Cluster 1 - "Efficient Stability Group": This cluster comprises companies demonstrating normal levels
#across various financial metrics, indicative of efficient and effective operation within their industry
#and competitive landscape. Dominated by American-based companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),
#they receive a balanced recommendation to hold their stock, suggesting stability and relatively low-risk investments.

#Cluster 2 - "Highly Valued - Risk Zone": Companies in this cluster exhibit a high price-to-earnings (PE) ratio
#and a low net profit margin, indicating that the market values their stock at a premium relative to current earnings.
#Despite the low profit margin, investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of earnings. This cluster 
#represents a higher level of risk, as these companies may struggle to meet market expectations, potentially leading 
#to a future decline in stock price.

#Cluster 3 - "Growth Potential - Low Risk Group": Companies in this cluster display low asset turnover and 
#high revenue growth, signaling significant growth potential with room for operational efficiency improvement. 
#Originating from various locations and listed on the NYSE, they receive a moderate buy or sell recommendation, 
#suggesting promising growth potential.

#Cluster 4 - "Debt-Stricken - High Risk Group": Companies in this cluster exhibit high leverage, low net profit margin, 
#and low Return on Assets (ROA), indicating reliance on substantial debt with insufficient profitability and asset returns. 
#This group, listed on stock exchanges other than NYSE (AMEX and NASDAQ), receives a hold or moderate buy recommendation.

#Cluster 5 - "Established Profit Leaders": Companies with high market capitalization, reflecting large, well-established #entities with significant market presence and financial strength. These companies, listed on the NYSE, receive a partial
#hold and buy recommendation, showcasing a strong market position and profitability.
